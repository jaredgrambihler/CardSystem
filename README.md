# Running and Compiling
This code is built for the [Java 11 (Corretto) JDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) and intended to be run in AWS Lambda.

The .jar file for upload to AWS can be created by using "maven clean package", which will output the compiled jar file in the /target directory.
